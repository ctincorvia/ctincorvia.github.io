                <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b>
                    <br> Most of my work for this class this week was spent grinding out the Australian Voting problem.  Despite relatively simple in concept, it turned out to be rather annoying to code.  Reading the input was a surprisingly frustrating task, and the meat of the problem turned out to be essentially an exhaustive case analysis inside of a loop.  Perhaps this was my fault, but due to the complexity of the main body of code writing unit tests was also a surprisingly difficult task.  All in all, this lab surprised me with it's difficulty compared to my expectations.  The technology tools, however, were not nearly as large of an obstacle this time.</p>
                <p><b>What will you do next week?</b>
                    <br> We do not have a lab for another few weeks due to the incoming test.  I plan to spend the time I would be working on the lab studying instead.  The content of the test, however, is still a bit of a mystery.  I imagine class material will be on the test, but I'm frightened if the cavas quiz questions will be used with a similar short time constraint.  The questions aren't unfair, we've nearly always learned the material in class, but code questions full of pointers are difficult to nail down in 30 seconds.</p>
                <p><b>What's in the way?</b>
                    <br> My other classes are now in full swing.  Though they're not incredibly intense, they'll reduce the amount of time I'm able to spend studying.  I'm not particularly worried, however, as I only have 2 other real classes.</p>
                <p><b>What's my experience in the class?</b>
                    <br> The lab this week surprised me.  I was expecting to have to spend very little time enumerating this rather simple algorithm, but between the odd input, case-heavy code, and occasianal unieldyness of C++ I was caught by surprise.</p>
                <p><b>What's the tip of the week?</b>
                    <br> Something I've been trying is treating the labs like they're due a day early.  So far this has meant that I spend a bit of time on the day the lab is due fixing up some last minute things-Handling the Doxygen documentation, making sure the remote repository is pushed to correctly, all the little things that are easy to lose track of during the push to complete the actual lab.  Documentation points are easy points.  It hurts when you forget them.</p>
