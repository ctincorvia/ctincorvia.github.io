                <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b>
                    <br> This week I spent grinding away at the darwin lab.  I had the misfortune of doing the lab in the wrong way, starting out, resulting in some unnceccesarily complicated code and thus an incredibly hard time getting it to work.  And once it did work, my solution proved impossible to optimize to be fast enough to pass the final test.  I wish I had known that speed of the overall program would be a focus, as I would have started the lab very differently.  I began with the simplest possible solution in mind, which was simply a poor solution in terms of speed and complexity, I discovered.</p>
                <p><b>What will you do next week?</b>
                    <br> As always, on weeks with a lab assigned, I'll spend some time understanding the lab and then setting up the workflow.  Once that's complete I'll spend some time, more time than the last lab assigned, working on the lab.  I plan to get this lab done one day early, rather than 3 minutes early, as I did last week.</b>
                <p><b>What's in the way?</b>
                    <br> I have a heavy interview schedule in the coming weeks, despite relatively little class. I'm not looking forward to that and balancing the final lab. </p>
                <p><b>What's my experience in the class?</b>
                    <br> Again, I'm wishing I could work with a partner.  I feel as if the last lab would have gone very differently if I had another person watching my back.  I'll have to stop and do a lot more thinking before I do ANY writing next time.</p>
                <p><b>What's the tip of the week?</b>
                    <br> Before starting the lab, immediately after setting up everything, spend some time mapping out how all of the methods and objects will connect.  I should have done that this last lab, and I'd have spent less time and I'd have a better grade. </p>
