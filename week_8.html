                <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b>
                    <br> This week was spent setting up the lab, mostly.  We've made good progress so far, but I am afraid this lab will become the Voting lab and end up much more complicated than it seems.  However, with only two classes (Friday was cancelled) and one of them dedicated to explaining the lab, there wasn't much material to review.</p>
                <p><b>What will you do next week?</b>
                    <br> As the coming week is spring break, likely very little. I'd like to think I'll be productive, but I have a hard enough time with that when school is IN session.</b>
                <p><b>What's in the way?</b>
                    <br> Just the final bit of the lab. With the input being successfully read, and the validate and allocate methods written, deallocate is the only thing standing in the way. </p>
                <p><b>What's my experience in the class?</b>
                    <br> Not a lot has happened since the last post because of the lack of class and lab explaining.  My first impression of the lab is that it's easier than Australian Voting, just because that turned in to a horrible mess of spaghetti code and if statements.  This one, while perhaps more complicated in concept, seems like it will be much cleaner.</p>
                <p><b>What's the tip of the week?</b>
                    <br> When labs are involved, my tip is always start early.  Also, go to the TA's for help with documentation even if you don't think you'll need it.  I paid very careful attention on the last lab and still lost 3 (of 80) points.  We're going to have to get a TA to clear us on this one before we turn it in. </p>
