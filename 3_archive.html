                <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b>
                    <br> This week I spent primarily getting the newly assigned lab to read the input.  Again, it appears the hardest thing about this lab is going to be getting the workflow to function properly rather than the actual algorithm.  With make, travis, and every line of code our responsibility this time, there's more setup than there is anything else.  I've mostly got make and travis working, and the framework for using iostream to get thr input functioning properly.</p>
                <p><b>What will you do next week?</b>
                    <br> The implementation of the Australian voting algorithm will be the biggest project for the coming week.  I think I've got an algorithm set up, but C++ can be finicky and I anticipate a few extra hurdles that are unforeseen.  Also the first OOP test is nearing, and I don't really know what to expect, so I'll be spending some time studying for that. </p>
                <p><b>What's in the way?</b>
                    <br> Again, the workflow and technology tools are my nemesis.  I've worked in industry before and had to deal with exactly this sort of workflow, but setting it up wholly myself and running in it beginning to end is a different experience.  Make is a new tool to me, and it's sort of up to us to handle using it.</p>
                <p><b>What's my experience in the class?</b>
                    <br> The quizzes have remarkably poor averages, ranging from at most 70 percent to as little as 30 percent on 4-choice questions and 50 percent on 2-choice questions.  I don't think this is due to necessarily unfair questions, but rather the very small amount of time we are given to do them.  4 questions in 3 minutes is a difficult task, especially when two or more are C++ code full of pointers and references.  I also don't think this poor average is due to inadequate explanation, Professor Downing is very clear.</p>
                <p><b>What's the tip of the week?</b>
                    <br> If you wish to do well on the quiz, be ready to be fast.  You can't rely on having enough time to "figure it out" on the quiz, you just have to know the answer, especially to the knowledge questions.  If you can't remember what Xtreme programming says about independently written code, pick something and move on.  You'll need that extra time on one of the coding questions.</p>
