                <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b>
                    <br> This week was spent going to class and preparing for the exam.  With no project due, there's no lab progress to report, and no strange bugs or unexpected difficulties to express.  </p>
                <p><b>What will you do next week?</b>
                    <br> The coming week will be spent doing nearly exactly the same thing.  I have some improvement I definitely need to make from the last exam.  I am however optomistic, as my notes this time are MUCH better, and I won't have to rely simply on the files that are up on the website.  They're excellent supplements, but without the notes they're just code without any explanation as to why.   </b>
                <p><b>What's in the way?</b>
                    <br> I have to wrap up a more than a few things for the final week of the semester.  I have a final project and paper due in the Ethical Hakcing Course, and I have to continue to hunt for an apartment, as I am now a real person who has to do adult things, unfortunately.</p>
                <p><b>What's my experience in the class?</b>
                    <br> I'm a bit frightened for the upcoming test.  I'm still not sure what exactly ill be on it, and the last one definitely caught me by surprise.  There was much less general understanding and exstensions of concepts and more C++ minutae, which I am not nearly as good at.</p>
                <p><b>What's the tip of the week?</b>
                    <br> Take good notes!  Without good notes, studying for the test is not fun at all.  Downing documents any code we write very well, but obviously the files that are put up on the website are static.  And the most important thing to do is not to understand only what the code is doing, but understanding why it's doing that.</p>
