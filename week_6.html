                <p><b>What did you do this past week?</b>
                    <br> This week I spent doing some review for the class, as the test is coming up on only a few days.  I admit I've done less reviewing than I should, but thankfully Professor Downing posts all of the code (rather than slides) up on the website with the schedule.  I don't have any real idea what will be on the test, not because the content of the class is unclear, but because we haven't discussed the format of the test at all so far.  Will it be multiple choice? Short answer? Coding questions? Who knows?  I must prepare for it all.</p>
                <p><b>What will you do next week?</b>
                    <br> MORE PREPARATION.  I plan to review all of the coding, and review the canvas questions (If they're available anywhere?), and reread all of the articels if I have time.  The textbook readings are of questionable worthiness, if the pattern of questions is similar to the quizzes.  There seems to be only one question out of the question per week, which pales in comparison to the questions from the articles and the class content itself.  I don't know if there will be any content from the labs on test, but I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of their contents regardless.</p>
                <p><b>What's in the way?</b>
                    <br> Honestly the only thing in the way of my preparation for this test this week is my own tendency to procrastinate and do as little work as possible.  If I do not perform well on this test, it will be my own fault.</p>
                <p><b>What's my experience in the class?</b>
                    <br> This was a light week, likely because I was supposed to be studying for the upcoming exam rather than laying around doing nothing.  It's nice to have a week off though, the labs are surprisingly time consuming due to the strict turnin requirements.</p>
                <p><b>What's the tip of the week?</b>
                    <br> Be smarter than me.  Do not procrastinate.  I'm going to be doing some heavy studying for the next few days, especially due to some surprises this week that are going to take up extra time (Interviews!  Friends coming in to town!).</p>
